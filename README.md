## To Do List
- [ ] Add hover state to all text links. I want a line underneath to animate in left to right
- [ ] Hook up Nav links to adjust home slider position, and work when coming back from blog page. Probably use URL parameters
- [ ] Add intro loader animation. Header frame needs to come in smoothly somehow. Still need animation inspiration for this
- [ ] Create 2nd slide on homepage for 2-3 paragraph bio.
- [ ] Write bio. lul
- [ ] Design Blog Cards
- [ ] Design Blog Single Template

## Ideas List
- [ ] Blog Grid on blog slide could be 3x3 grid layout. 
- [ ] Have cool video or particle as global bg instead of just the black
- [ ] Have left header frame text update every 2/3 secs with different things like time/date/weather, or an announcement like "RIP Virgil. You left a mark on this world"
- [ ] app style mobile menu
