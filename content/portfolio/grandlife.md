## Project Background
The Grandlife Hotels and venues are one of the legacy retainer clients at K&P. Over the course of three years, the designers and I worked on numerous page updates and unique microsites for each of their venues. Each microsite (Soho Diner, Cinema, Django, Gilligan's, Roxybar) possessed it own unique and whimsical design to help give each brand personality. This led to some challenge layouts and problems to solve via SCSS/CSS, but in the end, these are some of the most fun and playful sites I've created, which greatly improved my ability to translate a set of responsive designs into pixel-perfect code.
